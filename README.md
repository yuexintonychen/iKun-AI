# iKun-AI

Project Demo: https://yuexintonychen.github.io/iKun-AI/final.html

•	A Malmo AI Project about an agent finding its position and shortest path (Dijkstra’s algorithm) from source block to destination block in pre-built 2D Minecraft mazes using Deep Q-Learning with Neural Network and PyTorch multiprocessing

•	Adapted from the model in the Active Neural Localization project, the base model was trained with Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) reinforcement learning algorithm using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

•	Applied Bayesian filters to estimate the agent’s location depending on its observations and actions
