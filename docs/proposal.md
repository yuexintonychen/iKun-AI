In addition, we want to put some monsters and traps into the mazes to see if the agent could kill the monster and avoid traps. Our agent's input will be the voxels in front of its sight, which will be similar to what a normal player can see in Minecraft (However, we might also change this to be a small range of voxels around the agent). Also, the agent will be provided with a weapon (but it might be limited in amount). The agent's goal (output) will be trying to get out of the maze as fast as possible.# AI/ML Algorithms        We will be using reinforce learning algorithm (Q-learning as model free approach). We might be also using conventional shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm for comparing the difference if possible.# Evaluation Plan
