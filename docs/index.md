Hello, welcome to our CompSci 175 AI Project - iKun AI's homepage!

IKun AI is an Artificial Intelligence Project on Deep Q-Learning with Neural Network. The project is designed to let an agent play in a set of pre-built Minecraft 2D mazes. The agent is able to see the voxels in front of its sight, which is similar to what a normal player can see in Minecraft. The agent's goal is to get out of the maze as fast as possible using the limited resources that are given to the agent.
